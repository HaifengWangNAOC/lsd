Quick tests for new locking routines.

To test on pan, go to the src directory, and execute:

	echo "0" > /n/panlfs/mjuric/sumfile.txt; PYTHONPATH=".:$PYTHONPATH" ./attic/locking/test.py; cat /n/panlfs/mjuric/sumfile.txt

To test on odyssey, execute:

	echo "0" > /n/panlfs/mjuric/sumfile.txt; bsub < ./attic/locking/test.bsub

The test program will increment the number in sumfile.txt. For the
single-machine run, the final count must be 100 (if the locking works), while
for the Odyssey run it should be 8000 (80 machines x 100 each).
